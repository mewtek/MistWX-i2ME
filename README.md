i2ME is a compact data aggregator and distributor for The Weather Channel's IntelliStar 2 XD & IntelliStar 2 JR headend units.

For any support with this encoder, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hV2w5sZQxz), and we'll be more than happy to help out with any issues! Bug reports through this repo's [issues tab](https://github.com/mewtek/mistwx-i2messageencoder/issues) are also much appreciated, and helps narrow down what we need to fix.

**To get started, visit [our wiki!](https://github.com/mewtek/MistWX-i2ME/wiki/First%E2%80%90time-setup)**

## Features
i2ME handles data collection, record generation, as well as record sending through the unit's routine & priority message ports, closely simulating the way that real headends receive their data. On top of this, all files sent through this program are compressed through GZip, making files send much faster than the predecessor Python scripts.

Precipitation & Satellite radar images, while not finished, will be added in the near future.
